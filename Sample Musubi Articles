Hello world 🌏✨

Some journeys do not start with confidence — they start with curiosity.
My Contest 2023 journey with Hello World wasn’t a straight path.
It was many quiet nights, small breakthroughs, unanswered emails, rejections, guidance from mentors, and finally… alignment.

Landing the project felt like watching the first sakura bloom after a long winter:
unexpected, delicate, hard-earned, and deeply meaningful. 🌸

This is how it happened.

# The Beginning — Searching for the Right Project

Every student dreams of working with brilliant minds.
For me, that meant searching across organizations, reading proposals, and exploring areas where my passion for AI systems, reinforcement learning, and robotics could fit.

Hello World focus on advancing AGI safely felt like home.
# But reaching there required clarity:
What do they need?
What can I uniquely offer?
Where do my skills genuinely match the project?

# I started narrowing down:

* reading past Contest archives
* understanding mentors’ research
* identifying gaps I could fill
* building small prototypes to test my fit

Step by step, the path became visible.

# The Preparation — Building Signal Through Action -

* Applications aren’t won by words alone.
* They’re won by signal — proof that you care, you can build, and you can think.

# So I prepared:
* wrote clean proposals
* contributed to repos
* joined community calls
* asked mentors meaningful questions
* refined ideas repeatedly


# Slowly, my proposal began transforming into something real —
not a document, but a promise of value.

# The Breakthrough — Mentor Alignment

* One conversation changed everything.
* My mentor responded.

# We refined the proposal together:
* tightening objectives, shaping milestones, emphasizing why this project mattered to the broader research community.

# That alignment — that “musubi” point where two minds connect —
was the turning moment.

* The project was accepted.
* I was officially working with Google DeepMind under GSoC 2025.

It still feels unreal. ✨

# What I Learned — Lessons From the Journey

1. Consistency beats genius
Small, regular effort creates the strongest foundation.

2. Clarity attracts opportunity
The more precise your proposal is, the easier it is for mentors to believe in it.

3. Reach out fearlessly
A single good question can build a bridge that dozens of emails cannot.

4. Proof > promises
Show your skills. Don’t explain them.

5. Courage + curiosity = momentum
You don’t need to be exceptional to start.
You need to start to become exceptional.
